# Open Source Hanzi Fonts

By [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source), a software (or a game, a book, and of course a font) is _open source_ if its source code is made freely available for possible modification and redistribution.

In practice this always means you can do almost anything you want, just **do not be a dick**. For a more strict definition and comprehensive introduction to open source, please consult the Wikipedia page.

In this page we list some open source Hanzi fonts:
- [文津宋體 / 文津明朝 / WenJinMincho](https://github.com/takushun-wu/WenJinMincho): A large Han-ideograph character set Songti (Mincho) font suite mainly derived by [Source Han Serif](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-serif) and Han glyphs generated by [modified Kage engine](https://github.com/ge9/kage-engine-2/), and the glyphs are mainly presented in China mainland glyphs standard (aka G source).
- [超威德鑫 9pt 小篆 / SuperDexin-9pt-Zhuan](https://github.com/SuperDexin/9pt-Zhuan): A font of Seal script (篆書).
