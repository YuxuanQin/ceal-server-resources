# How To Contribute


Contributing to this site is easy! (Relatively). This site is made using MkDocs, a markdown-based (i.e. no fancy complex code) documentation site generator. This page is aimed at those who don't really know how to, or care for, coding or technical work, but still want to add resources. As such, I will try to skip over as much of the "install python, configure dev environment, etc, etc, etc" boring stuff as I can.

## Prerequisites

- Know how to write markdown. See [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/mkdocs/) for a reference of the MkDocs markdown dialect.
- Know, or be willing to learn how to write yaml.
- Have a GitHub account and know how to navigate the site. [Click here to go to the GitHub page for this project](https://github.com/yanwenywan/ceal-server-resources) or from the icon in the footer from any page.
    <!-- - One important thing to understand is _forking_ a repository. When you fork, you create a duplicate of my project in your account, where you are free to edit and upload files.  -->
- Knowledge of Git and a code editor is helpful, but _not required_. You can create, upload, and edit markdown on the GitHub web interface, though you will not be able to run and preview the site yourself.
- *(Only if you want to run the site locally)* Python 3, with the `mkdocs`, `mkdocs-material`, `mkdocs-material[imaging]` (and dependencies) packages. I won't go into further detail because that's not the aim of this page.

## Guidelines 

- ***Keep the file sizes lean.*** Only upload markdown and image files. For any large files, such as PDF scans, csv dumps, etc, it's best to use a public link from a hosting service like drive, and just link it here. 
- ***Try to categorise things nicely.*** Take advantage of the categories, folders, and subfolders we have.
- ***Make frequent commits.*** A "commit" (see [Submitting your work](tutorials.md#submitting-your-work)) is a checkpoint of your changes, so each single "change" you make (e.g. adding a page, editing a paragraph, adding a set of dictionaries) should be one commit. When you merge back in, you can merge multiple commits at once, so don't worry about making small, frequent checkpoints.

## Final Words

- See [Tutorials](tutorials.md) for some tutorials walking through different possible use cases and covering the whole process from making an edit using the GitHub web editor, to merging your contribution into the site. The whole process can be quite technical and the tutorials may not cover every case, so please take advantage of any other resources available to you.
- See [Useful Tips](useful-tips.md) for any fancy functionality that I've enabled, that may not come in vanilla markdown. These can help you better format and present your page.
